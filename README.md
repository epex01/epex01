- 👋 Hi, I’m @epex01
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring the intersection of technology and creativity. Whether it's through coding, digital art, or innovative projects, I love blending different fields to create something unique
- 🌱 I’m currently learning learning advanced Python programming, Laravel. If you have any cool resources or projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source software projects, creative tech ventures, or anything that combines art and technology. Let’s build something awesome together.
- 📫 You can email me at michaeljabor@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: king/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’ve designed UI mockups for fictional apps just for fun—like a space-themed travel planner and a virtual pet that can give you design tips! It’s a great way to let my imagination run wild and test out new ideas.
